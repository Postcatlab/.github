Postcat is a powerful open source, cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Browsers...) API development and testing tool that supports REST, Websocket and other protocols (soon to support GraphQL, gRPC, TCP, UDP), helping you speed up the completion of API Development and testing work.

While ensuring that Postcat is light and flexible, we also designed a powerful plug-in system for Postcat, allowing you to use plug-ins developed by others to enhance Postcat's functions with one click, or develop Postcat plug-ins by yourself, so Postcat is theoretically a As an API product with infinite possibilities, we also visually added a cape to Postcat's cat, representing its infinite possibilities.
